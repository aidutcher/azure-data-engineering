Learning to design and implement data engineering solutions in the Azure ecosystem

Currently working through A Cloud Guru's "Microsoft Certified: Data Engineer Associate (DP-203)" course, which covers various topics and services related to data engineering in Azure.  This repository will serve to store application code, IaC templates, resource configurations, an any other relevant materials that I create throughout the learning process.
